# Project Overview: YouTube Description Link Generator

This project involved creating a client-side web application to help YouTube creators manage and generate formatted lists of tools, assets, and other resources for their video descriptions.

## Core Functionality Implemented

1.  **Item Management:**
    *   Users can add, edit, and delete items, each consisting of a name, URL, and a type (e.g., "ツール", "素材サイト").
    *   All data is persisted in the browser's local storage, requiring no backend server.

2.  **Text Generation:**
    *   Users can select multiple items from their master list.
    *   "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons were added for convenience.
    *   The application generates a formatted text output, grouped by item type, ready to be pasted into a YouTube description.
    *   A "Copy to Clipboard" button allows for easy copying of the generated text.

## Development Process

1.  **Requirement Definition:** Collaborated with the user to define the initial requirements, which were then saved to `requirements.md`.
2.  **Scaffolding:** Created the initial `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.
3.  **Iterative Feature Development:**
    *   Implemented core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for list items.
    *   Added the text generation and copy-to-clipboard features.
    *   Enhanced the application by adding item "types" (区分) and grouping the output accordingly.
    *   Added "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons based on user feedback.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Updated `requirements.md` to reflect the final state of the application.
    *   Created a `README.md` with a project overview, a link to the live application, and instructions for local execution.
5.  **Deployment & Version Control:**
    *   Guided the user on how to deploy the static site to GitHub Pages.
    *   Managed version control by staging, committing, and pushing the completed work to the user's `main` branch on GitHub, including resolving a `.gitignore` issue.
